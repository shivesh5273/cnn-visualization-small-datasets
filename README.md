# CNN Visualization & Small Datasets Practice

This project covers a series of exercises exploring CNN behavior, feature extraction, and visualization techniques, using Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.

## 🔍 Project Breakdown

### 📷 1. Image Blending using OpenCV
- Blended a sparrow image with a sky background.
- Experimented with different weight ratios for natural blending.
- Used subtraction to separate the blended layers.

### 🐶 2. CNN Training on Cats vs Dogs
- Built and trained a CNN on a small portion (1000/500/500) of the Cats vs Dogs dataset.
- Implemented EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint callbacks.

### 🐲 3. Visualizing Intermediate Activations
- Visualized activation maps from early, middle, and pooling layers.
- Used a resized dragon head image (150x150 pixels) for inference.

### 🎨 4. Visualizing Filters
- Loaded a pre-trained ResNet50V2 model.
- Generated images that maximally activated various convolutional filters.
- Displayed 8–16 activation visualizations per layer.
